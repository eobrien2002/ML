This is an extension of my ML NHL draft prediction project. It uses NLP techniques to retrieve intent and facilitate a conversation with a user. It can provide statisitcs
for a given player name and can make predictions using the ML models for draft picks. It combines software engineering capabilities, machine learning, deep learning, and 
natural language processing techniques.

This project was presented at the 2023 CUCAI competition. A front-end web app is in development
