Hi,

This project was my attempt at building an LTSM Neural Network. It is an English to French translator. Unfortunately, my laptop does not have enough ram and so my model only uses 1000 words from the dataset. If you have more ram please change the number of lines in the pre-processing section. Additionally, please download the text file data from the following link: http://www.manythings.org/anki/ Note, you will also need to change the name of the text file the script reads if you want to use a different language.

I hope you enjoy it! Ethan
