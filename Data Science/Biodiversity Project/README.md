Hi!

The purpose of this project was to showcase my python skills. I took two datasets, one on species in the 4 US Midwest National Parks, and the other on observations of those species, and cleaned the data. The goals of my analysis were to determine the distribution of species, what types of species are at the most risk, which species are observed the most, and then what is the distribution across parks for these species, and create a function that filters the data based on an input keyword like bear and return information on observations, etc. The project displays some more advanced python abilities that can translate to other development projects.

Thanks in advance, Ethan
