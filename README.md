Hi! 

My name is Ethan OBrien and I am a student at the Ivey Business School set to graduate in the spring of 2025. I am pursuing a dual degree in Mechanical Engineering and the Ivey HBA. However, I am super passionate about software development and data. This repository contains all of my big projects to date. Whether you are a recruiter, a classmate, or a member of the public, I encourage you to check out my hard work! My coding knowledge is entirely self-taught. Through Codecademy courses, online tutorials, and trial and error, I have managed to learn all of this so far. I love to learn new things and can't wait for what's to come! 

Thanks in advance, 
Ethan
