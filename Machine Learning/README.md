My NHL project looks to predict the draft pick for a player using classification models. The project demonstrates data cleaning, data exploration, feature engineering, various ML models (Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and a simple and complex MLP Neural Network), ensemble methods (Random Forests, Bagging, Boosting), and hyperparamater tuning. 

I am currently developing a front end interface for the 2023 CUCAI competition.
