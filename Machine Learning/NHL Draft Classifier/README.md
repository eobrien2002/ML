Hi,

This project aimed to build a classification model to predict if a player would be drafted in the first round of the NHL based on their amateur statistics. I went through a complete data science process. I begin by exploring the data, then I cleaned it and prepared it for the model. I scaled and standardized it and removed outliers. I then used feature engineering including PCA, Sequential Forward Selection, Sequential Backward Selection, and Recursive Feature Selection to reduce the dimensionality of the model. I then explored ML models including Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbours, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and a MLP Neural Network using TensorFlow. I improved the model using ensemble methods, and in fact, improved the SVM base model by 10% using a bagging classifier. Techniques I used included Random Forests, Bagging, and Boosting. Finally, I use hyperparameter tuning, specifically GridSearchCV to fine-tune the parameters. I finished with an 82.2% accuracy model using the bagging SVM. 

I hope you enjoy it! Ethan
