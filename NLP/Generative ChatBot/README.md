This project uses an LTSM neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras. First, I built a scraper to get tweet and reply pairs from twitter. I then trained the LTSM model 
on that data and implemented it into a simple chatbot that can have a conversation with the user. The model is trained on 10,000 tweets so it is not that good.
