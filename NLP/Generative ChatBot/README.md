This project uses an LTSM neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras. First, I built a scraper to get tweet and reply pairs from twitter. I then trained the LTSM model using that text data. The tweets are preprocessed, trained, tested, and then implemented in the chat bot. The model is trained on 10,000 tweets so it is not that
good. Please run the `chat` file to engage with the chatbot
