Hi!

The purpose of the this project was to use my NLP knowledge and build a retrieval based chatbot. Please note, this project is uncommented and still in development stages. It uses bag of words and term frequency inverse document frequency to find entities and a word2vec model to find user intent.

Thanks!
Ethan
