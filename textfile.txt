Just for the record, you‚Äôd have to be completely off your rocker if you wanted to remove hitting &amp; body contact out of game. It‚Äôs woven into the very fabric of competitive hockey.

@enews WHAT?  No way!  Shocking. NOT. ü•±
Updates from the Senators today are about as bad as they could be -- goalie Anton Forsberg done for the year with tears to the MCL of BOTH knees. Like a car accident victim. Elite rookie D-man Jake Sanderson out for ten days at least. Yikes. Sogaard-Mandolese for now in goal.
@HockeyScanner 2) for every strong move by dorion, there has been one that has hampered this team. I have zero confidence in his ability to take this team to next stage.  Gus the bus was given up on too soon.  If they would of drafted Wallstedt. Everyone knows you need a top goalie to compete.

More on the Chychrun situation: Bruins GM Don Sweeney is reportedly very concerned about Chychrun‚Äôs injury history. Likes the player, but is unsure about risking the future on him. Arizona has been very patient and feels a trade with either the Kings or Bruins is imminent.

The Panthers are recalling Grigori Denisenko from AHL Charlotte, per the NHL Media site.Denisenko played last night and scored the OT winner Friday for the Checkers. This season he has nine goals and 21 points in 37 AHL games and three assists in 12 games with the Panthers.

That first NHL goal feeling for Alex Belzile ü•≥
@BR_OpenIce The size of the head on Sundin, looks like a cabbage patch doll gone wrong.
How about this for modern hockey. Kovacevic and Harris are the two players to lead the rush to win the zone for Montreal. That leads to Belzile and his forward mates working down low to make it 1-0.This isn't your Dad's NHL anymore.
@BWildeMTL That‚Äôs what I was thinking. :)

Alex Belzile scores his first NHL goal at 31‚Ä¶. Love seeing stories like this.
@worldhockeyrpt Exactly in my opinion that's how coaches lose the dressing room. Once that happens it's the beginning of the end for the coach
Alex Belzile scoring his first NHL goal at 31, after years in the ECHL and AHL, is a fantastic story.

Belleville has lost 3 in a row since firing Mann, and sit 8 points out a playoff spot. It's a great time to start moving UFA's for picks and giving some young guys a look.The system has dried up quickly with so many good players moving into the NHL. Time to start getting picks.
@TSNSimmer Is it too late to get Andy back for a pick lol
Here is Creighton, in the middle of a sprawling metropolitan area, one minute away from an 18k seat arena. The other is UConn in the middle of fucking nowhere, where their arena choices are a 45 min drive for an old arena the NHL deemed inhabitable or a small student rec center.

@HockeyDaily365 If a player unintentionally high sticks or trips another player, it‚Äôs still a penalty- intentional or not. So even if Makar stepped into it and the hit was unintentional, the fact is that Carter hit Makar‚Äôs head. How or why does the DPS say that‚Äôs not a penalty?

@randybobandy_99 Our faces all the time and who cares that it is. Sexuality is a part of existence and it‚Äôs beautiful.Saying spare me is because the argument is hypocritical unless that same energy is being held towards straight sexuality as well. It just means ppl don‚Äôt want to see LGBTQ+

@GopherWHockey Maybe Mr. Frost shouldn't be so happy they fought back from being down 2 goals. The girls can and should be able to handle criticism when their play is not getting the job done. Constantly being milktoast when faced with these challenges does not make champions. Ask Herb Brooks.
The Eastern Conference is crazy good.
@HockeyDaily365 If a player unintentionally high sticks or trips another player, it‚Äôs still a penalty- intentional or not. So even if Makar stepped into it and the hit was unintentional, the fact is that Carter hit Makar‚Äôs head. How or why does the DPS say that‚Äôs not a penalty?

@torontobaghead @hockeynight She wants to turn it into a non contact sport like women‚Äôs hockey. Not a big fan of her.
The worst team in the NHL improved on this tonight. That's an embarrassing loss.
@koshtorontosun Earily similar to how Columbus beat Leafs in the playin round in 2020. Work harder, play more physically, go hard to the net where the Leafs let opponents bang away at loose pucks and at the other end take away the centre of the ice, give the Leafs the perimeter. Will beats skill
The Toronto Maple Leafs just lost a game to the worst team in hockey
@PeterkaToQuinn 100% i care very little. my dad wants me to bring him snacks for it tho so ig i gotta think about it a little bit
Tonight marked the third time this season (Nov. 10 at DET, Dec. 7 at VGK) in which the Rangers have scored four or more goals in the third period. New York ranks second in the NHL in third period goals (69) and fourth in third period goal differential (+19).

@AGoldFan @giglio_OG heard during the espn+ broadcast of the 16th hole at Scottsdale. Paraphrasing "We have the best referees in the business. The same can't be said for ACC basketball"

@JacketsInsider They‚Äôre going to make quite a dynamic duo next year in Columbus
There's only one defenceman in the league who ranks top-3 at both skating the puck out of the defensive zone &amp; into the offensive zone, per 20 at 5v5 - Chychrun.Pair that skating / puck moving ability with physical play, great defensive stick &amp; modest cap hit, a lot to like.

Bastian and Hartman fight after Hartman comes to Kaprizov's defense....Wild were getting a power play, but refs evening it up ...2-5-10Evason is incensed. Bad call on Ek leads to a goal, and there was interference not called on the Tatar goal....Bastian dropped his gloves first
@RussoHockey @JoeSmithNHL Any chance Wild have interest in Jakob Chychrun?
Breaking: Jakob Chychrun has been traded to the Regina Pats for Connor Bedard and a 1st
@BillArmstrongGM Please do something
Phil Kemp is an effective defenceman in the AHL and has made progress in his three seasons in Bakersfield. This year, he owns the best even-strength goal differential among the team's defenceman. Does he have an NHL future? Here's a look.
@Lowetide How about now?
Frank Nazar III unassisted goal, his first as a Wolverine!
@umichhockey Thats what I do when I fart too.
This is already the best jersey retirement in @LAKings franchise history... And it's only about 5 minutes in. Incredible.
@mayorNHL Was fantastic to listen to.  This officially took over as my favorite episode over the Roman Vopat one...

Blais hits the bar, which would've been his first NHL goal since ... he left the Blues.
@jprutherford I think it's cool that Sammy and Vladi both scored in their first game witha new team !
‚ÄúGood news Oilers fans, Ken Holland got you that puck moving defenceman you‚Äôve been wanting‚Äù
@AdamsOnHockey I‚Äôd rather touch base on a potential potential Provorov or Parayko deal than take on and pay that price for the back end of that EK65 contract.
Closing out the regular season in style!
@DinosWHKY Sweet.
Friedman at the intermission says Kravstov, who is a healthy scratch tonight, is available.
@NHL_Watcher Ken Holland has no problem dealing out any and all draft picks.
UFKO HAT TRICK!!X
@UMassHockey If only he could play defense.
Mitch Marner is up to fifth (tied) in the NHL in assists.He‚Äôs got two tonight (after two last night) and 45 in 54 games this season.
@jonassiegel @Marner93 is a BEAST!!!Has ALWAYS been my favourite @MapleLeafs.The man has vision like no other player.
Lots of fun today with @BrianBoucher33 and @leahhextall in Dallas‚Ä¶@TBLightning and @DallasStars put on a great show‚Ä¶We have plenty more ABC doubleheader Saturdays on the way as we head towards the @NHL playoffs‚Ä¶hope you‚Äôll join in!
@espnbob Tremendous stuff.  Thanks for sharing.
Dustin Brown allowed me to make fun of every NHL fanbase that hasn‚Äôt won the Stanley Cup and I will never forget him for that
@theroyalhalf ü¶à
Marek at the intermission says teams interested in Tyler Bertuzzi, are Dallas, Yzerman and Nill have a relationship. Edmonton has had some interest as well as Tampa. Detroit is asking for a substantial return for him.
@NHL_Watcher Ken Holland has no problem dealing out any and all draft picks.
Dylan Duke redirects a Luca Fantilli chance and it's 2-2!

@FlowHud @HudsonOHSports @hockey_ohio @TeamOhioHockey Looking forward to watching him break the record next Sunday.
After missing the whole season until making his season debut yesterday, Blackhawks prospect Frank Nazar gets his first college hockey goal and is fired up
@m_bultman In the highlights he looks fully recovered. Hands. Swagger.etc. How is his speed? Again, in highlights, he looks great.
Former Kings Jeff Carter, Alec Martinez, Jake Muzzin, Kyle Clifford, Jarret Stoll, Matt Greene, Rob Scuderi, Mattias Norstrom, Rogie Vachon, Dave Taylor, Luc Robitaille, and Rob Blake take the stage.Along with the legend Bob Miller.

Friedman at the intermission says teams have called the Sens about Alex DeBrincat, but they have told teams he will not be moved at the deadline. Sens would like new ownership to settle in and try and attack contact extensions with him again.

FINAL: 3-2
@ohiohockeyd2 up 1-0 on @Hockey_IU after 1.*Ohio not applying too much defensive pressure past center ice after they took the lead 1-0. Very conservative play by the Bobcats. It held the Hoosiers scoreless through the end of 1.

Friedman at the intermission says there appears to be a path to a Zaitsev trade, he's hearing West Coast.
@NHL_Watcher Ken Holland has no problem dealing out any and all draft picks.
Not the outcome we were hoping for...
@Kentucky_Hockey We liked the outcome... (Good game though!)

@NHL_Watcher Ken Holland has no problem dealing out any and all draft picks.

@PuckReportNHL I am Czech and I agree with Mr. Ha≈°ek @hasek_dominik. Most people I know would agree with him too. He speaks the opinion of the majority.
Marek at the intermission says when it comes to Chychrun and being a healthy scratch for traded related purposes, it's definitely not the Oilers, the Leafs have said no as well...
@NHL_Watcher Ken Holland has no problem dealing out any and all draft picks.
So NHL that trade talk gets spicy on a weekend where all eyes are on another sport.
@AndrewBerkshire The refs just want Bedard in MTL next year, thats all.
GOAL @taylorheise9 with the SHORTHANDED goal for her 22nd of the season! 1-0
@GopherWHockey Maybe Mr. Frost shouldn't be so happy they fought back from being down 2 goals. The girls can and should be able to handle criticism when their play is not getting the job done. Constantly being milktoast when faced with these challenges does not make champions. Ask Herb Brooks.
Mark Filippeli scores with 7:50 left in the second 3-1
@MaroonBlackPuck @CoachRickSodo And in the process beat that team up the street for the 3rd time in one winter. Well done to all! Such a fun group to watch compete.

Daniel Laatsch's first career game-winning goal (just his second collegiate goal in 58 games) put the men's hockey team ahead for good in a 3-1 upset victory against No. 1 Minnesota at the Kohl Center.UW's first win against a No. 1 since 1/9/21, also 3-1 vs. Minnesota.

@CockHockey How can i watch a game. Also why is the hockey team not on any of the websites under sports???
47 saves for our goalie, Abby Huselid (Andover‚Äôs 4th goal was an empty net). We have a bright future with both Abster and Addi Brandt back for more next year. Another reason it‚Äôs good to be an Elk! ü¶å
@elkriverpuck Great goalie and top notch kid !!! Great game

One thing you can see tonight is how much Brodin covers for Dumba with his anticipation and positioning. His incredible skating enables him to play Dumba‚Äôs side when needed. Best d-man in Minnesota‚Äôs NHL history.
@jzulgad Fun fact- The Stars have been in Dallas longer than they were here.

NHL officials definition of "intent to injure" is a lot more lenient than mine is. What's Nylander trying to do here if not hurt Blankenburg? He misses, sure, but this should be more than two for roughing.
@camcharronyvr Thank you Cam.

Artemi ‚ÄúBreadman‚Äù Panarin has scored his 200th NHL goal!!
@Zibanejesus only ever been to MSG but my godddd it is unreal
Chychrun is good. Issue is his PP ability either takes away from Rielly or is made redundant on PP2. Also Timo Meier will cost less assets and is way better because forwards impact winning more than defensemen.  But it's better than getting bums who don't move the needle at all.
@Account4hockey KD HAS To get meier or chychrun
An incredible number of people tell me that we can‚Äôt change hockey‚Ä¶I just don‚Äôt agree.Our future @freeplayforkids shows a positive picture instead.
@TimAdamsFF @PlayersCanadian

Jakob Chychrun being healthy scratched for ‚Äútrade-related reasons‚Äù and then not being traded would be the most NHL thing ever.
@ClendelWark He will be traded, maybe not today, but you don't risk him getting a season ending injury if things are happening

@TauntonHSHockey @MassHSHockey Congratulations on your Milestone Cam! Keep it up frozen one
The NHL is a silly league where a guy like Phantom Jake is on a cup contender‚Äôs roster over Will Cullye not because he‚Äôs better than WC, but because he costs ~$100k less and those savings roll over until the trade deadline.
@BlueshirtsBreak Fil does the same thing. He looks so embarrassed.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs right behind me isn‚Äôt he‚Äù
@NHLJets Bones ü§ù ME...being greatful enough we know the teams playing (and at least ONE player I'm sure haha)
If it‚Äôs not the Oilers, then I hope he‚Äôs going East. This seems like a Bruins move. A smart, deep team making an all-in move to try to win it all. Take notes.
@AdamsOnHockey I‚Äôd rather touch base on a potential potential Provorov or Parayko deal than take on and pay that price for the back end of that EK65 contract.

Jesperi Kotkaniemi sticks with his own rebound and beats Halak to quickly push the Hurricanes ahead!
@HockeyDaily365 If a player unintentionally high sticks or trips another player, it‚Äôs still a penalty- intentional or not. So even if Makar stepped into it and the hit was unintentional, the fact is that Carter hit Makar‚Äôs head. How or why does the DPS say that‚Äôs not a penalty?

@NHLRussell @am_urbach Realistically, trading Clarke away at age 20 for 2 1/4 seasons of Chychrun (before a major raise is due) seems like a major misstep for the future, especially if a 1st or even two 1sts is included. Of course you have to give up to get, but losing Clarke seems a bit much

@InsideWisconsin I like you're enthusiasm. I've become numb to wins like this from the hockey team the last couple years. Granado hasn't been an upgrade over Eaves. Two seasons with a winning record and 102-125-16 overall &amp; 1 tourney appearance, a disappointment. It's time to move on from Tony.

END OF SECOND: 2-1
@ohiohockeyd2 up 1-0 on @Hockey_IU after 1.*Ohio not applying too much defensive pressure past center ice after they took the lead 1-0. Very conservative play by the Bobcats. It held the Hoosiers scoreless through the end of 1.
So the US got there first and shot it down.Come on Canadians tell the truth, you all had a hockey game going didn‚Äôt ya
@trapperjohn37 Meanwhile, back in the crazy factory in Washington, Joey is yelling CodeRED about climate change.

@KevinWeekes @NJDevils @espn @NHL @NHLNetwork @TSNHockey @DKSportsbook Send out an amber alert
Am I the only one getting tired of Jenn Botterill? I think she needs to go cover women's hockey where it's all nice and there's no hitting or fighting and they all wear cages. After listening to her tonight it's clear she does NOT get the NHL game! I think Bieksa is tired of her.
@WpgJetsStats I like  her. She‚Äôs one of the best ever on the ice for women‚Äôs hockey.  She‚Äôs from Winnipeg, and she knows her stuff.  I‚Äôd argue she‚Äôs one of the best.
For you college hockey fans Lindenwood's men's team defeated Stonehill 10-3 this afternoon to sweep the two-game series. Oakville High's Jack Anderson, a 6-6 defenseman, had one of the Lindenwood goals.

@HkyNightPunjabi @RandipJanda @HarpPandher Magic
Let's play some hockey
@StLouisBlues @Chiefs common admin W
It‚Äôs unbelievable to me how some people just don‚Äôt get that Trotz leaving the wasn‚Äôt just a standard coach firing. Trotz had coached NHL hockey non stop for 22 years. He just had a family tragedy and wanted a break and wasn‚Äôt going to sign an extension. It‚Äôs that simple.
@VoiceIslanderFn This is my take as well, for what it's worth. The question is whether there is any chance of reeling him back in, at least for the rest of the season.
On on hand, there are many risks with Karlsson. His defensive metrics are poor, he's at a career-high oiSH%, he's 32, and he has a $11.5M cap-hit.On the other hand, who doesn't want to watch 97, 29 and EK together? Screw it, double-down on all-offence and win every game 10-9.
@NHL_Sid Even if the oilers get him they will continue to rely on nurse and that will forever be a disaster and they will never win. And in 2 years when 97 and 29 leave u will be stuck for 6 more years of 25. And still no cup. That will be the biggest fail ever
Time for some Saturday night hockey!  Tune into MSGSN as we kick off the 4-game roadtrip! We‚Äôre expecting playoff energy tonight against a Minnesota Wild team desperate for a win.
@ErikaWachter My mom is so heckin cute
Jennifer Botterill suggesting hockey doesn't need physicality to be entertaining. What a joke man. It's not even hockey at that point.
@SuperBrandonEh She‚Äôs out to lunch
Is Jennifer Botterill seriously saying that the league has to be looking at legal open ice hits?  We‚Äôre watching the death of hockey on @hockeynight.  Bieksa and Hrudey are looking at her like she‚Äôs an alien!!  Fuck!!!
@leafsin2030 @hockeynight I think she was complaining about fights, but maybe it was about hits, I don‚Äôt remember, but I don‚Äôt mind her. It‚Äôs her opinion n she‚Äôs entitled to it just like Don Cherry was entitled to his. TV sports panels are useless if it‚Äôs always the same pov expressed
Huge start to a massive weekend still plenty for tonight(DM) tap in if you want more   @OutlierDotBet
@lucaswildboy19 He was so happy with her, i hope he doesnt go back to that dark place he was in (when he was about to off himself)
Jennifer Botterill is an idiot when it comes to hockey being played physically. We need big hits. Keeps the game honest.
@JB248899 When she speaks I either FF past her on my PVR or just change the channel. I can‚Äôt listen to her

@GopherWHockey Maybe Mr. Frost shouldn't be so happy they fought back from being down 2 goals. The girls can and should be able to handle criticism when their play is not getting the job done. Constantly being milktoast when faced with these challenges does not make champions. Ask Herb Brooks.

Chychrun is busy with a graded Pok√©mon card purchase
@SEllisHockey IDK, Kraken at 10 then chores for the rest of the day. Seems reasonable to me
Hopefully today's loss will end the talk about the Sens being buyers or sellers at the deadline. This is a .500 hockey team, that will be picking in the top 10 of a very good draft.

@hockemania Internet Explorer
Jakob Chychrun is a healthy scratch tonight for ‚Äútrade related‚Äù reasons, per Coyotes.
@NHLRussell @am_urbach Realistically, trading Clarke away at age 20 for 2 1/4 seasons of Chychrun (before a major raise is due) seems like a major misstep for the future, especially if a 1st or even two 1sts is included. Of course you have to give up to get, but losing Clarke seems a bit much
F-Mika Zibanejad has scored in 4 straight games.
@NHL_Watcher Ken Holland has no problem dealing out any and all draft picks.
It would be great if the decided to light things on fire with blockbuster trades this weekend. Super Bowl, Who?
@inside_the_rink Man, a goalie is taken out with such a gnarly injury and it wasn't Binnington. The hockey gods are truly cruel sometimes. Best of luck with your recovery, Anton.
Mika Zibanejad sticks with it and converts on the power play to open the scoring for the Rangers!
@HockeyDaily365 If a player unintentionally high sticks or trips another player, it‚Äôs still a penalty- intentional or not. So even if Makar stepped into it and the hit was unintentional, the fact is that Carter hit Makar‚Äôs head. How or why does the DPS say that‚Äôs not a penalty?

@PuckReportNHL I am Czech and fully agree with Dominik Hasek. Mr. Ovechkin is simply a friend of a war criminal. And you admire him. What a shame!
nothing like that pit in your stomach when you hear a group of junior hockey players are being suspended pending investigation
@hockeynuisance ‚ÄúNo further details‚Äù??? Enough with the secrecy and coverups!!!
Linesman Devin Berg and ref Chris Lee correctly react to a seldom seen play. Bos D-man tries to slide his teammate's stick back to him and knocks puck away from WASH player. 2 min for interference, and had it occurred in D-zone, it would have been a penalty shot for WASH.
@ESPNRefNHL @SuperChronix @TSN_Sports Fair enough, but the players are the ones who have microphones shoved in their faces immediately after the game, while emotions are still high. It just seems like players are being set up to fail, while the refs are so protected by the NHL that we never get both sides of a story

@RobCelletti He killed this team in the playoffs last year. He's won 57% of his faceoffs. If you don't think he's light years better than Strome, I don't know what games you're watching. Lest you forget he's had to deal with Gerard "No System" Galant as his coach. It takes time to adjust.

Why, THE FUCK, does NHLN still broadcast games? Why? Another bush league attempt by the NHL to emulate other leagues but there aren‚Äôt enough viewers to make it worth a damn. are a major market team with a back to back on the weekend and you stuck them both on NHLN??1/

@hockeynight Aww the refs feeling got hurt.
Merzlikin's 0.870 is the lowest a goalie with 20+ GP has had since CuJo put up a 0.869 in 2008-09 with the Leafs. Dan Cloutier had a 0.860 in 2006-07 for Los Angeles.

@umichhockey Thats what I do when I fart too.
Oilers live and die by their offense. That‚Äôs when they‚Äôre most dangerous. I don‚Äôt think the team is built to play it safe.Imagine Karlsson feeding McDavid at full stride in the neutral zone.That‚Äôs hockey worth watching.Let‚Äôs go all in.

Nicklas Backstrom on huge 2-1 win over Bruins setting the tone for second half: "I think this is the time when teams are starting to get together and playing good hockey, more playoff style hockey. It‚Äôs going to be tight...Hopefully this will give us a good little boost.‚Äù
Laviolette on Hathaway's performance: ‚ÄúHe played really well. He was physical. His nose was dirty tonight. He had a big goal. You just found him the middle of everything.‚Äù

Hockey doesn‚Äôt get me too emotional,  I‚Äôm an old soul who watches way too many hockey games, but today was special. Getting my father-in-law (of Ukrainian descent) to see team  today at the @tournoipeewee is right at the top of the list.
@Jerome_Berube Can we just make it not count in the regular season standings? Because it kind of becomes an irregular season for a couple teams, doesn't it? Let's make it a preseason novelty!
From a broadcast perspective [ESPN on] ABC had an excellent six hours of NHL coverage today -- and just that fact they had six hours of NHL coverage is obviously a positive.Arguably their best broadcast(s) over the past two seasons.
@jheaps4 @Zone_NHL @HelltownBeer I can give ya a funny NCAA story. I‚Äôm an avid UMaine fan and whenever they‚Äôre on TV, I go to the Facebook group and tell them, and the amount of times people say I‚Äôd rather watch it on ESPN+ and I have to explain that them watching on network helps has become infuriating to me
Our group for game two.
@GopherWHockey Maybe Mr. Frost shouldn't be so happy they fought back from being down 2 goals. The girls can and should be able to handle criticism when their play is not getting the job done. Constantly being milktoast when faced with these challenges does not make champions. Ask Herb Brooks.
It's almost time for a Metro Division matchup!The @NYRangers are in North Carolina to take on the @Canes. The puck drops at 7pm ET / 4pm PT on NHL Network.|
@NHLNetwork @Jackie_Redmond @mike_p_johnson @Rupper17 Islanders. It would be nice to see. It won‚Äôt be them because nothing ever like that happens to isles getting a young unbelievable player that changes the way the game is played. So yeah, the Islanders.
According to Gary Bettman, no team ever tanks and the has the best officials of all pro sports. You can't make this up! More dillusional than that and they lock you up in the loony bin!

In ESPN‚Äôs post-game, Buccigross seems to have hinted at Messier and Chelios being in Raleigh next weekend for the Stadium Series. I believe this would be the first-time this season (outside of All-Star Weekend) that ESPN has sent their studio team on-site.
Also want to note that 2020‚Äôs Stadium Series between the Kings and Avalanche is the least-watched NHL outdoor game on network TV.
The Blackhawks have set a high price tag if they're going to move defenseman Jake McCabe:

@IanBlogsHockey @CheechYouFTF Retaining as much as they did, would‚Äôve hoped they got quite a bit more out of that deal. Was a lot of real cash and cap space being used for Burns not to play for them and Carolina gave up nothing of real significance.
My take on the hockey scuffle from yesterday:1. I've seen that exact scuffle break out in about 33% of every hockey game I've ever watched2. It's UM-MSU, shit will always get heated3. UM coach's comments postgame were clown stuff4. Tonight's game will be popcorn-worthy

Not a classic but Lightning take both points after a shootout. It was not the highest quality but in the end it was just about good enough. Liam Stewart with the deciding penalty shot. 3-3 after regulation and overtime. It was 3-2 in penalty shots to Lightning after 6 rounds.

@mamanion @fr_aquilini You realize Aqualini said those same things publicly as well, right? Gaglardi mentioned last year that he didn‚Äôt like how younger players were getting paid more, hence the Jason Robertson bridge contract that was signed this year, he‚Äôs going to really get paid on his next deal.

Shades of Sidney Crosby on this goal. Specifically I‚Äôm reminded of his puck protection against Ryan Strome when he was still an Oiler. McDavid is *still* growing and getting better. What a terrifying player.
@AdamsOnHockey I‚Äôd rather touch base on a potential potential Provorov or Parayko deal than take on and pay that price for the back end of that EK65 contract.

@mizeryindex @MizzouHoops Same, so I just said ‚Äúwhy not me‚Äù
For everything we said about possession, the league never got that far. NHL couldn‚Äôt find video evidence that Matheson was in the zone before the puck. Can‚Äôt argue. I didn‚Äôt see it either.
@brendanmburke Goal was good. Had it been overturned, and the game went to a shootout, there's NO DOUBT Isles would've lost anyway. In any case, this was a horrible, inexcusable loss. Horvat is making a difference, but what the Isles really need is a return of Trotz.

Parayko would be a pretty intriguing fit for Ottawa. End of his contract would show some decline, but he is stylistically what they need and has several good years left in him.Odds that he'd waive the NTC for Ottawa, though? Probably low.

This would make the Oilers unbelievable in NHL '94 with no line changes on.McDavid with Draisaitl and Hyman on the wings? Karlsson and Nurse on defense? You could have some fun with that line.

All Senior starters for your Catamounts - Morrissey, Murphy, McCool, Gray &amp; Holmes!
@UVMwhockey Congratulations Seniors!
needed that. Seven unanswered goals in a 7-2 win today in Buffalo.Jakob Pelletier‚Äôs first NHL goal and point. Dennis Gilbert‚Äôs first multi-point game in the league. Jacob Markstrom gets his first win since January 6th vs. NYI.Trip wraps up Monday night in Ottawa.
@Fan960Steinberg Markstrom has had criticism, but I wonder how his performance would improve if the team was scoring more and taking the high pressure off him as the sole source of a chance to win. have been so weak on offense; must improve their methods, not personal talent levels.
3 more NHL plays I have for tonight and one of them is coming as second Freeplay shortly‚Ä¶Ready?!
While Toronto is competing to be at least in the play-in zone, Detroit wants to get a better draft pick. The Raptors have a more versatile roster and should win this game easily.
DUBBBBBBBS!
@NHLFlames Jakob Pelletier, but in the list it's Backlund imo.
Yes, there is a hockey game going on, but it's tied and there's been 47 shots combined through 57 minutes so I'm gonna keep counting Eagles chants.

This is basically instant replay in most sports. It works well in tennis and to review goals in hockey, and badly in almost everything else.
@dilanesper That allegedly smart people are surprised when a computer program does what it is asked to do is ‚Ä¶ odd.  Either they don‚Äôt understand it, or it‚Äôs for clicks.
Here‚Äôs my thing. Much hullabaloo was made about Bouchard learning from Duncan Keith. Can you think of a single defenceman in the NHL youd want Bouchard learning from more than Erik Karlsson? I can‚Äôt.
@AdamsOnHockey I‚Äôd rather touch base on a potential potential Provorov or Parayko deal than take on and pay that price for the back end of that EK65 contract.
Buffalo native and @NHLFlames player Dennis Gilbert had a just a couple of fans in the stands today for their game against the Sabres in which he found the back of the net!

Some quick notes on that Erik Brannstrom goal:* First goal since February 25, 2021 (120 games)* It's his 3rd career NHL goal -- and first one scored in front of fans (two goals in COVID season)* He had 159 shots on goal without scoring.
@ian_mendes For the life of me I have never understood why defensemen deem it necessary to push an opposing forward on top of their own goalie. I‚Äôve seen so many goalies get hurt because of this at all levels of hockey.
There's no other hockey venue like the Bell Centre.
@tedtheodorou But he isn't wrong. How could he know this group will lose to way less talented teams? Well history in the playoffs supports that, he can only work with what he has. And Heart and Grit are not part of many of these guys games.

The penalty shot is the dumbest rule in hockey. If the player misses, there should be a power play afterwards.
@andrewwadden Penalty shot and PP no matter the outcome of the shot
The Sabres have 6 shots on goal in 36 minutes of hockey. If Donny isn‚Äôt throwing garbage cans between periods‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
@DuaneS39 Why's everyone speaking in absolutes? If they don't make it, they don't make it. No one expected the Sabres to contend for the playoffs so why is it so imperative we make a deal so we do? You're talking about casual fans who barely follow the team. Any real fan can see the growth

@HHouse222 The worst is that these people bitch about the govt and the condition of our country.  In my experience they are the PP supporters who think I should just get over it when I regularly call out their role in feeding power to the Trudeau (and provincial) totalitarian regime.

NAZEM KADRI IS A CALGARY FLAME! 4-2 US!
@NHLFlames Jakob Pelletier, but in the list it's Backlund imo.

@NHL Why are they practicing outdoors? Are they in an outdoor game soon?
Dennis, being a menace in his hometown
@NHLFlames Jakob Pelletier, but in the list it's Backlund imo.
Jakob Pelletier‚Äôs family made the long drive to see him score his first career NHL goal in Buffalo.Now Buffalo product Dennis Gilbert has his first with Calgary in front of his friends and family.score three goals in 1:47 and now lead the Sabres 3-2 in the second.
@Fan960Steinberg Markstrom has had criticism, but I wonder how his performance would improve if the team was scoring more and taking the high pressure off him as the sole source of a chance to win. have been so weak on offense; must improve their methods, not personal talent levels.
Nylander Over 3.5 SOG - have a weak defense - Nylander is attempting 7 shots over his last 10 games

D Dennis Gilbert, with dozens of family and friends in attendance, scores on a slapper in his first NHL game in his hometown of Buffalo. How cool is that?

@TMobileArena part of the fun of being here before gates open is watching all the visiting fans or newbie fans realize that their huge backpacks can't make it through security then do walk of shame to lockers or car.
Jakob Pelletier scores his first NHL goal! And it's a beauty!
@RingOfFireCGY @FlamesNation Most concerning to me in the article is the ‚Äúquick re-tool‚Äù.  Not sure that a re-tool with a couple faces is what‚Äôs needed and skeptical that it could be quick and off to the races next season. Is what Detroit did years ago by building their team from the draft possible anymore?

@EricFrancis Pelletier is from Quebec city, not Montreal, its about a 2:30 hour drive from there. Just so you know for next time.
Name a better duo than the Sabres and allowing 1st NHL career goals
@PeterkaToQuinn 100% i care very little. my dad wants me to bring him snacks for it tho so ig i gotta think about it a little bit
A lot you can teach in hockey. Can't teach Denis Gurianov's speed. Sheesh.

it‚Äôs not like ppl actually have to choose between ‚Äúmiller always sucks‚Äù and ‚Äúmiller can do no wrong.‚Äù valid criticism of his play isn‚Äôt ‚Äúmiller hate‚Äù. he is capable of playing good hockey and he is also capable of being an absolute dumbass. both can be true.

One of my favorite venues in the NHL, Centre Bell in Montreal. Early start time today. 12:30pm puck drop on MSGSN. @IslesMSGN
@brendanmburke Goal was good. Had it been overturned, and the game went to a shootout, there's NO DOUBT Isles would've lost anyway. In any case, this was a horrible, inexcusable loss. Horvat is making a difference, but what the Isles really need is a return of Trotz.
take ice for warmups for noon game vs. Vancouver. Raymond not taking warmups, so this will be the first game he‚Äôs missed in his NHL career after 132 in a row. Lower body injury in practice yesterday. Walman (shoulder) also out.
@AnsarKhanMLive thank god

Christian Wood's passing has been on display in a few recent possessions tonight against the Kings.-Found Reggie Bullock on a cut out of "Horns." -Found Theo Pinson out of "Zoom." -Near Hockey assist playing at the nail. Wood later converted on multiple 3-pointers.
@GrantAfseth I think the greatest thing to take away from this is that this is the first game of meaningful NBA basketball together and while that was disappointing, they will work through it
Pierre Engvall frustrates a lot of fans because he's 6'5" and not physical. However, he's certainly an effective NHL forward.If he was physical, the Leafs couldn't afford him

Few bragging points for beating the worst team in the NHL. Still, the in third period shrug off a Blue Jackets team that had shown some life. 3-0 final, Marner is Marner, Tavares scores two, Samsonov with 30 saves.
@koshtorontosun Earily similar to how Columbus beat Leafs in the playin round in 2020. Work harder, play more physically, go hard to the net where the Leafs let opponents bang away at loose pucks and at the other end take away the centre of the ice, give the Leafs the perimeter. Will beats skill

The Canadian WNT/XNT isn't just fighting its federation for equality. They're fighting for the resources simply to be able to compete at the necessary level even though they're a top contender for the world cup. Incomprehensible.

Gavin Brindley has been excellent since returning from the WJC. With 1+1 so far tonight, he's extended his point streak to 8 games. He has 6 goals and 14 points over that span.
@Hockey_Robinson Didn‚Äôt his streak technically end with the suspended game?

Again asking the NHL to explain to me how having the brother in law of someone the head coach of the Maple Leafs has had an extensive dark history isn‚Äôt a conflict of interest and would have no outcome on the refs feelings towards the coach or his team
@Noah_Banx @Totally_Offside Timmins was in even worse shape when traded. The thing is, no one is offering their top prospects. NYI unloaded Raty because he's a 0.5ppg AHL player. So ultimately, you often see guys like Robertson and Timmins in these deals because they have value b/c of their ceiling.

This looks like an all-in year, with the upcoming cap crunch.Arthur Staple said on NHL network the other night and said that the mandate from ownership was to do whatever they could to improve.I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs Kane, but I have a strong feeling that Drury is not done.
@92In82 @flaguy12 I think it's this simple. If Kravtsov and Lechyshyn swapped everything except their heritage, I doubt Lechyshyn would be sitting in favor of Kravtsov. Jake simply gets the benefit of the doubt because he's North American and his father played in the NHL.

Working on making the comps a lot better. Right now, because of side constraints, you can only see the players that made the NHL. In the future you'll be able to see everybody, even the busts and developing players. Which will give a far better picture of where the player falls.

Wolf Pack have seven games before NHL deadline so Hajek might be able to play his way into a trade piece sought by a needy club. Of course, if he plays that well, Rangers would want and need him for playoff run depth.
@NYP_Brooksie He‚Äôs definitely going to be traded. Even if the asset isn't that great or he‚Äôs an add-on to a deal, Drury will have to recoup something before the trade deadline or at the draft. If not, his 1-yr contract is up &amp; he won‚Äôt come back‚Ä¶they‚Äôll end up with no return at all

Friedman on 32TP: "I heard a lot of rumblings about a Boeser-for-Greenway kind of deal. After really looking into it, I don't see it. Bill Guerin kind of talked about it on Mike Russo's podcast".
@NHL_Watcher That's going to bump of the asking price to at least two first rounders, right @DevilsInsiders?
Kieffer Bellows on waivers comes with a risk of course.Islanders have option to place him directly on Bridgeport if they claim him (and are only team to claim). Every other team would be required to keep Bellows in NHL if they make a claim.Flyers would be at 11 F so stay tuned.
@BobRotruck This is very good news

Friedman on 32TP says the Devils are being asked about their young defensive prospects. Most likely not Nemec, he's not going anywhere, but Reilly Walsh, Shakir Mukhamadullin, Nikita Okhotyuk, he may need waivers next year so teams are asking NJ what they are thinking there.

Falcons will most likely remain in 3rd in the regardless of what happens this weekend. They are 7 points clear of Bemidji and 8 clear of Ferris. Those teams are duking it out this weekend in Big Rapids. A BG sweep would move them into a 2nd place tie with Tech.

To be explicitly clear - you do not give up on 22-23 year old defensemen playing Top 4 NHL minutes.  You just don't.  They are very rare.  They will make mistakes.  They will drive you nuts.  But they will improve.Romanov and Dobson are very good hockey players.
@conti129 Whether or not Lane is a good coach, for me, remains to be seen.  But I admit that I'm sour on him right now.

Wonder if Chevy will be able to pull off another Stastny-type deal. There are the familiar names that keep being talked about as possible trade candidates, but maybe it's a player that hasn't been mentioned very much.
@spinohockey Maybe Chevy will try to bring back Stastny for a 3rd time for a 6th or 7th round pick. ü§î
It's a solid deal for the team, as Harris has played like a bonafide NHL defenceman this season.The Canadiens have that fiscal certainty on defence, allowing them the flexibility to make a move or spend newfound cap space elsewhere this summer.

Jordan Harris, signed to a 2x$1.4M extension by MTL, is a young defenceman who had put up very strong results in a third-pairing role as a rookie, especially on the penalty kill.
@JFreshHockey Quick really, really nose dived in play this season. He‚Äôs been avg to real good the last 3-4, but this year, considering that he‚Äôs not fighting an injury, at least it hasn‚Äôt been said he‚Äôs hurt, is bad. Sad to see a dude with so much fight in him go through this.

@ad_grays @self_pass That‚Äôs a ridiculous comparison. Hockey already has its own T20 version (indoor/6s). It‚Äôs more like cricket adding another international format &amp; calling T19.Adding more international formats doesn‚Äôt grow the game, it dilutes the limited resources &amp; players we have.

At first, when a couple of us interested people raised our concerns about the threat of hockey5s for the future of hockey (indoor but mostly outdoor) were called fundamentalists, haters, resentful.Now that we all realize how wrong this invention was, can we please we stop it?
@self_pass This clearly explains the sad situation
Could you imagine a U14 hockey team with a World Champion super-G skier and the world's best hockey player?Jack Crawford and Connor McDavid used to play together in Toronto, and it was McDavid's skill that convinced Crawford to stick to skiing. A remarkable and unlikely duo.

Bo Horvat &amp; Anthony Beauvillier were a part of the same trade &amp; both scored a goal in their first game against one another. This is the 3rd time over the last 25 @NHL seasons that players who were traded midseason for each other, both scored in their next game as opponents.

Hearing rumblings from insider sources that Hermantown is going to be proposing a giant trade package for Tyler Hennen. Offer may include a 7 figure deal and send Kittson several Bantam AA players and possibly an Assistant Coach. More details tomorrow.
I think Shakopees win over Holy Family settles the debate but Holy Family may be able to flip it in the meeting. As for Chan - Tonka debate. Chan needs to win out. If Chan gets swept by Benilde I would flip Tonka to the 1 seed and they still may get it even regardless.

Eric Staal scored two shorthanded goals and became the fourth player in @FlaPanthers history to achieve the feat, joining Olli Jokinen (Nov. 19, 2002), Radek Dvorak (Dec. 12, 1997) and Tom Fitzgerald (Oct. 13, 1995).:

In 2019, the only year the missed the playoffs since 2011-12, the Wild came out of the break and lost 9 of 10. Now 3 in a row and 6 of 8 overall. This is a team that typically gets their sh*t together when written off, but as I said last night, ominous feeling right now

@KurtLeavins With the mess the Cap is, do you foresee a lot of roster cleansing this summer with RFA‚Äôs being allowed to walk rather than sucking up cap space? I know injuries play a part but looking at the Oilers, those guys in their Arb years aren‚Äôt covering their tab.
Elias Pettersson (2-1‚Äî3) recorded his 22nd career three-point game ‚Äì the most among all @Canucks players since @_EPettersson made his debut in the 2018-19 campaign.:

This is a game that had to speak volumes to Guerin. They need some kind of shakeup, a spark, some hungry guys from Iowa, something. Just a horrendous defeat and poor effort up and down the lineup.

had 23 giveaways to Canucks nine. An angry Lane Lambert calls it all "unacceptable.""When you're up 4-2 in a hockey game, late in the second period and you don't win the hockey game, you feel like you've let something slip. There's a certain amount of frustration."
@AGrossNewsday It‚Äôs really going South quicks. Pens killing it in West Coast. Caps just beat Bruins. Devs/Rangers surging. And us, we‚Äôre losing to Vanc., Montreal. If they lose in Ottawa, you can‚Äôt let Lambert on the plane home. Sorry.

going to dwell here.  I saw more that I liked than I didn't.  You're not going to lose many hockey games scoring 5 goals and Ilya had a terrible night.  It happens.  So long as they get back on the win wagon we just keep grinding.Horvat and Barzal are remarkable.
@islanders_takes @AndreMinassian will take this down to March 3 to decide, as they should. Everyone knows there is a mandate to make the playoffs and make serious bank to help pay off the arena. All of the organization's actions still say they'll go for it until they believe they are out of it.
I am proud and excited to announce my commitment to play division 1hockey and further my education at RPI. Thanks to all my family, teammates, billets, advisor and coaches for believing in me. Huge thanks to the Camrose Kodiaks organization for pushing me to reach my goals.
@LucasLemieuxx Atta boy Lucas! Congratulations
Pettersson's 5 on 5 numbers are ridiculous this season. Could easily make the case he's the best 5 on 5 player in the NHL right now.His shooting percentage his below his career average. He should heat up even more down the stretch here, especially with a soft schedule.

@RingOfFireCGY @FlamesNation Right. Know it‚Äôs a tough decision but mediocre team &amp; low enthusiasm is tough for business too.

Former NHL players, Bernie Saunders and Jamal Mayers, were both @WMUHockey Broncos. Bernie played there from 1975 to 79 and Jamal from 1992 to 1996. Here are their NHL rookie cards with Quebec and St. Louis respectively.
@blackhockeycard @WMUHockey Reading Bernie Saunders' autobiography right now. Really fascinating read, he is very thoughtful and perceptive.
Matthew Knies is quickly becoming one of the most overrated prospects in hockey. Not saying that because he‚Äôs a Leaf. But his apparent untouchable status is completely unwarranted and there‚Äôs no way the Leafs should be reluctant to trade him for a star like Timo Meier lol
@CaufieldHabs2 I don‚Äôt understand how he‚Äôs been watching this and refusing to do anything. There are  teams willing to take him

22 days ahead of the NHL‚Äôs trade deadline, Kyle Dubas spoke on the Maple Leafs‚Äô potential approach this year. "If there‚Äôs a way we can improve the team and give ourselves a chance to make a run at it, then we‚Äôll do that." (@lukefoxjukebox)

@EmeraldCityHky This is a great line!
I know not everyone likes to look ahead, but Edmonton's cap situation is - if anything - even more dire next year than it is this year. This season needs to be all-in. Bouchard and McLeod need new deals, Skinner's extension kicks in. This mock lineup has 275k in cap space.
@AdamsOnHockey I honestly don't know if i'd take Joel Edmundson even if Montreal gave us their 1st round pick this year to take him. I'd legit rather play Ryan Murray on the top pairing than Joel Edmundson.

Interesting tidbit from today: The ref hole to speak to the NHL officials between the penalty boxes now has covers on it. Why? The subtle yet safety change was made after Mason Appleton broke his wrist back in November in Seattle, Appleton and Adam Lowry said today.
@ScottBilleck Pretty sure we still had possession of the puck on one of the times it fell off, so play should've continued according to precedent. I could be mistaken though.

@hawk_NHL @DinoKristaLV ...&amp; there is ZERO excuse for it.

Hi
@HockeyRenegade Good morning
According to sources, @frank_seravalli's new trade board is coming out tomorrow at Noon ET on @DailyFaceoff Live on The Nation Network Youtube page.You may want to tune in for that.
@thegoldenmuzzy Still can't understand why they want to trade him, watched him live vs the oilers last year, and he was unreal against McDavid and Leon.
"I¬†couldn't care less and am still gonna wear my low cut shirt if I wanna."There is major drama brewing between OnlyFans star @MrsAllieRae and some hockey moms talking "sh*t."
@Outkick Is this the first sb w two starting qb‚Äôs from Texas?   That would be the main story of the day.

From 2014-2019, Vladimir Tarasenko ranked 3rd in goals (182), 17th in points (356), 2nd in even-strength goals (135), and 6th in game-winning goals (31)2014-15 was his best season: 37 goals,  73 points in 77 games, with 22.7 Goals Above Replacement - 2nd best in NHL.
@STLBluesViews @StLouisBlues It‚Äôs not that deep. The chiefs voted for the Rams to move but so did almost every single team. St. Louisans aren‚Äôt gonna keep rooting for a team owned by Kroenke, so they‚Äôre gonna pick MO‚Äôs team.

@lgbradio love the pod but gotta call you out on a comment you made about Blais. It was said no one thinks he will get 15 goals a season. He had 8 in 36 in 2020-21. And some gorgeous. Showed the touch again tonight. Not saying he will be a huge goal threat. But don‚Äôt sleep on him

Last season, the were all about acquiring Trouba's friends. This time it's Kakko and Bread's turns
@RachelNHL I want him to succeed here.Gallant will not let that happen. So, if Gallant is coming back next year you have to move the kid.I'm in fantasy land here but use him as part of a package to get Timo Meier and go win the cup.

@vzmercogliano He seems to be getting better on forecheck, positional play, driving to net with and without puck, defensively/backcheck, taking body and making hits. With his size/speed, he‚Äôs an ideal 4th liner impact guy. Really don‚Äôt understand GG. Sometimes he just has blinders on

The New York Rangers have acquired all-star Vladimir Tarasenko from the St. Louis Blues
@hockeynight Aww the refs feeling got hurt.
The Flyers are in the process of terminating the remainder of Linus H√∂berg's NHL contract by mutual agreement. After he clears waivers, he will return to Sweden. H√∂gberg has often been scratched this season in Lehigh Valley.
@billmeltzer I will assume the front office wore KC jerseys, not because they are fans of the Chiefs, just because they are inept.

Honestly it doesn't change anything. Tarasenko, Blais, Mikkola are all pending UFAs. Skinner, late 2023 first tround pick weren't a part of NY's 2023-24 varsity picture.Drury's cap math for this summer remains just as it was.
@HockeyStatMiner Does he shop at garden state mall

The Rangers have announced the full trade that brings Blues RW Vladimir Tarasenko to New York
@TheAthleticNHL @DNBsports No chance he‚Äôs coming. He‚Äôs one of the guys that didn‚Äôt get along with Evander kane.
Back in 2010, NYR held the 10th overall pick. They selected meat and potatoes defender, Dylan McIlrath. He played 66 career NHL games. Six picks later, Tarasenko went to the Blues. A wrong has finally been made right.

@ThomasDrance I tried that Gretzky Cream, it's good. If BAILEYS was an EP40 wristshot, then Gretzky Cream would be an EP40 SLAPSHOT!
A quick reminder that a more expensive, older UFA with worse stats just returned a 2023 1st and a 3rd. If you Timo proposal can't beat that, you're not getting Timo Meier (younger, better, cheaper this year, RFA).
@halfwall_hockey Would actually probably work out.
I‚Äôd pay the higher price for Meier. I would not pay the higher price for Kane. This is going to be fascinating.

Welcome to New York Tarasenko
@DaveyUpper Matthew Roberton will be solid in the NHL . . . if he gets in the habit of doing likewise.
I think the 'steal' is really not losing Kravtsov, Jones, Othmann, etc. The trade itself feels like fair-to-good value in of itself; but all the assets NYR have to lean into for the potential 2023-24 cap crunch are still with them. Good stuff!

In his career, Tarasenko has scored 30-plus goals on six different occasions, with his career-high total coming in 2015-16 (40). Since 2014-15, he is one of three skaters in the NHL (others: Alex Ovechkin, Auston Matthews) to post 33-plus goals in six or more different seasons.

It's a full slate of @JrProspectsHL hockey on tap this weekend from the Great Plains Arenas in Calgary, AB!Catch all the action on @HNLiveCA --&gt;
@4vengeancemedia @JrProspectsHL @HNLiveCA Why do your camera people zoom in all the time so the viewer misses half the play? It's very frustrating for parents that can't get out to see the games live. We can't even see if our kids are on the ice on some shifts.
SAMMY BLAIS AND LIBOR HAJEK ARE OFF MY FAVORITE HOCKEY TEAM
@based_shesty Rags fans are so toxic
He‚Äôs so right for this
@PredsNHL what time does this start at?! before or after puck drop?!
me reading about trade announcements vs me reading about kraken trade rumors... it's all fun and games until it's your team
@stressedhockey I was at a game where he got a shutout and he pulled the net down His names Yaroslav Askarov if anyones wondering!
Congratulations to our U15 &amp; 1st XI boys teams who both reached the national hockey finals after victories today Our U15 boys won 3 v 2 on penalties v Loretto &amp; our 1st XI won 3-0 v Edinburgh Academy to make the final of the Scottish Cup
@strath_sport @StrathallanPrep @ForgandennyPS @StrathallanSchl Amazing work - congratulations to the gymnasts and everyone involved in the competiton
Lauzy hyping up Jeanner during a fight is everything
@PredsNHL what time does this start at?! before or after puck drop?!
I told myself I wasn‚Äôt gonna cry when it happened but here I am. sure it‚Äôs a business but as a diehard hockey fan you can‚Äôt help but get attached to those ‚Äúfranchise players‚Äù. Tarasenko was a huge reason I love this team as much as I do. this hurts so bad.
@leahck55 He will go to a contender and unfortunately the blues are not that this year
Vladimir Tarasenko's career between the 2014-15 season to the 2018-19 season‚Äî182 Goals ‚Äî135 EV Goals ‚Äî29 Playoff goals ‚Äî6 straight 30+ goal seasons‚Äî356pts‚ÄîWon the Stanley CupTarasenko regained prime form last season, can he do it again with the Rangers?
@BigHeadHcky People think he is a terrible bust sure he not the elites goal score we hopped for and a bit over paid
If you aren‚Äôt willing to let go of a player you like in order to win the Stanley Cup, I don‚Äôt understand you. not meant to be a criticism, just an assessment of why I watch the  NHL.
@stormcellar97 whats the best ‚Äòillegal‚Äô mean ;)
Vladimir Tarasenko traded to the @NYRangers.A down year offensively but still top 35 in scoring chances. Gets a lot of looks off-the-rush &amp; knows how to get open in quality areas when cycling - top 35 in pass receptions in the slot.Put him with Panarin and there will be goals.
@MikeKellyNHL Thank you, from a Caniac.  The Canes are one dimensional and the teams in the East know this.  If the Canes don‚Äôt execute flawlessly they get burned.
Placed on NHL waivers today: Libor Hajek (NYR). Linus Hogberg (PHI) placed on unconditional waivers for contract termination.
@reporterchris @JesseBlake The contract is for quite a while. 6 months ago Karlsson was a boat anchor. What about 6 months from now? It‚Äôs extremely short sighted. I wouldn‚Äôt want him even if SJ retained and sweetened the pot.
Today marks my 8yr anniversary with Reebok/Adidas Hockey. It has been fun and an honor to create for the sport I love. The NHL has never looked better. @adidashockey
@ericbodamer @adidashockey You are the absolute GOAT
Happy for our man! Antonio Felidi is Committed to play college hockey next season at Florida Gulf Coast University, in Fort Myers, FL. Congratulations Antonio!

@nucksmemes Biggest trade of the day so far tbh
Thank you Vladi, for everything. From scoring twice in your first NHL game to bringing the cup home, you are legendary. St. Louis will miss you and always love you.
@leahck55 He will go to a contender and unfortunately the blues are not that this year
Vegas replacing the best defensive winger in the NHL with the worst defensive winger in the NHL would be very funny
@JFreshHockey This ranking looks fair.
Thanks, Mike!
@NHLRumorsDaily So basically its not LA then
Morning work.

@JFreshHockey This ranking looks fair.
Vladimir Tarasenko is reportedly leaving the only NHL franchise he's ever known
@YahooSportsNHL @Boyd_1212 Love it
Wow Rangers are getting Vladimir Tarasenko from the Blues! I think Kane's injury scared them away from him. Also I think Tarasenko was the best get for them contract wise. Huge get! Rangers respond to the Isles big trade with one of their own!!
@KHallNY @hotniks6 Who plays RW2 then?
The @MapleLeafs lock up Timmins
@OFFSIDETALK @MapleLeafs @BlueJacketsNHL @CardsSmitty @boxingrockbeer Apparently time to shut the bed against the worst team I. The nhl.
Thoughts on having a season series trophy for Gophers/Becky in hockey??A smaller version of the axe would be the obvious choice. The teams could even do a chop down of the goals on each end. Passed on year to year to the team that gets the most points H2HYay or nay?
@FutureGophers It‚Äôs the Motzko resume until proven otherwise.
- 5th all time in goals - 5th all time in points- 9th all time in assists- 6th all time in hat tricks - 7th all time in powerplay goals - 3rd all time in game winning goalsTruly one of the greatest to ever wear the Blue NoteThanks for everything Vladdy
@joshhymanNHL Donato thought he got traded to the Rangers too
New York Rangers Expected To Acquire Vladimir Tarasenko
@prohockeyrumors I'm truly curious how much LAKings GM R.Blake offered them for Chychrun.
Back in the win column! Our @EHL_Hockey team defeats the RoughRiders by a score of 6-1, Charles Lavoie led the way with 2 goals and an assist.|

NHL insiders stay the worst. Woj or Schefter would have tweeted the return and the gate that Tarasenkos flight to NY was departing from by now.
@ImmortalLou30 Nope ill be in Vegas
Finally, the trade was really just Buchnevich for Tarasenko
@HockeyStatMiner Does he shop at garden state mall
I believe they‚Äôre neck and neck with NJ for Meier
@NHLRumorsDaily So basically its not LA then
The Wolves are committed to social equality, which makes us proud to celebrate inclusion and diversity‚Äîin hockey and throughout the world‚Äîduring Black History Month.
@Chicago_Wolves Hell yeah!! ü§ô
Vladimir Tarasenko loves playing at Madison Square GardenThis is my favorite Vladdy memory, ever. Funny it happened against the Rangers.
@joshhymanNHL Donato thought he got traded to the Rangers too
Probably means they‚Äôre out on Meier
@hangarhockey @NHLJets
Glad I cashed that bet
@NHLRumorsDaily So basically its not LA then
The NHL‚Äôs top Connor imo
@AdamWylde just finished the Friday SDP. Never stop liking @McLarenF1 tweets.
Tarasenko to the should mean one less candidate in the Timo Meier sweepstakes.
@JamesNicholsNHL Your kidding right!? The month of January didn't scream playoff team, it screamed losers!
NHL insiders only telling us half the trade:
@OTCeIIy @Raezillaa Nah y‚Äôall are being completely fair. I have been getting shit sleep and am just grumpy that‚Äôs on me. I genuinely wasn‚Äôt trying to come at you. Just was trying to poke fun and then snapped when you took offense instead of handling it better. That‚Äôs on me.
Seamus and Eamon Powell, two brothers from Marcellus, play hockey at Boston College.Last week, Seamus scored his first college goal on an assist from his older brother.‚ÄúFor it to happen on the ice in front of people, my mom and dad, it was awesome.‚Äù

i am a hockey fan asking for a team to trade a player to a division other than the metro
@bwstanley26 It‚Äôs four in a row, we won game five last year. Still a long way from the finish. Good luck to the Rangers the rest of the way. I want them to make the playoffs.
Vladimir Tarasenko, traded to NYR, is a top six sniper. Still very dangerous off the rush in particular. His production at 5v5 has fallen off this season after a big jump last year, but he's still a good chance creator.
@JFreshHockey This ranking looks fair.
NHL has entered the chat
@BetMGM Hacked tho exposing customer snnAlbieted hashed it's only a matter of time before the kitties expose the salt
Vladimir Tarasenko joins a long list of players who have personally scorned me and will therefore see zero success in the NHL. He will never win another cup. I‚Äôll make sure of that.
@EthanGSN Exactly. It‚Äôs a personnel problem. This Roster is still so flawed. Losing Toews and leddy over the last few seasons has left a gaping hole on the roster. I don‚Äôt think Lane is it but this roster still needs a lot of ‚Äúretooling‚Äù

I just don't understand how you can be that referee or even the NHL for that matter and determine that Makar and Carter "ran into each other" when Makar literally stood still as Carter drove his elbow into his head. Ref had full view of this too. He should be fired on the spot

The NHL should treat headshots the way they treat high sticks. Accidental high stick‚Ä¶ ‚Äúyou are responsible for your stick at all times‚Äùa blindside headshot should not be classified as an ‚Äúunfortunate collision‚Äù ‚Ä¶ be responsible for your checksHope Cale Makar recovers well
@Cottstigan Just so you know, you can high stick a player if it was a result from the follow thru of shooting or passing the puck, so there are times where it isn't an automatic call.It sucks that Makar is out, no one wants any player out with an injury.

Oh, and we almost forget on Jake McCabe! Except the last season, he's been legit TOP4 defenseman since ~2019. He's strong in the defensive zone especially. Don't forget, he played in 2020/21 with Ristolainen and still was one of the best defensive defensemen that year.

Flames defenseman Rasmus Andersson was struck by a car Wednesday, the team announced.Andersson is ‚Äúdoing well‚Äù and is listed day-to-day.
@TheAthleticNHL @DNBsports No chance he‚Äôs coming. He‚Äôs one of the guys that didn‚Äôt get along with Evander kane.

@ToddMilewski Any chance Wisconsin backs up the Brinks truck and gets Mark Johnson as men‚Äôs hockey badger coach?
The best possible forward addition? It is undoubtedly Timo Meier from the San Jose Sharks. He's an elite forward in second year in a row. Still only 26 years old and you can control his contract a bit, despite this QO is $10M. The Sharks could get a big package for him.

@DIIIHockeyNews @AUSpartanhockey @MSOEHockey What do you mean? 65 went in and got the win! Sounds like a great night to me!
After horrible start into this season, John Klingberg proved again he's very good offensive defenseman. If your team has a legit chance to win, has great defensive-system, but terrible PP, Klingberg is your choice. In our eyes, he's not a good fit for playoffs to be honest.
@ARHockeyStats Assuming Karlsson would want to go to EDM and EDM could make the right package, how do you feel about Nurse-Ceci and Kulak-Karlsson splitting the top minutes?
If you want to win the Stanley Cup this year, you should try to acquire Erik Karlsson. But you also must have first-pairing defensive defenseman to protect him. This year it's right time for the Sharks to trade him. Karlsson's value should be high.

@KacyHintz Big addition back into the lineup
I (Rono) don't know what to say about Patrick Kane. He could be a huge addition but also terrible acquisition. Kane still has one of the best hands in the world. He's an offensive machine. But trade a 1st round draft pick + A prospect/good young player for him for example? No.

I really don‚Äôt get the narrative that the NHL has no player movement when in the past 14 months we‚Äôve had Eichel, Gaudreau and Tkachuk. Player empowerment is improving and I honestly don‚Äôt even want it like the NBA where a star wants out every week.
@MikeBartner Sorry the Bruins will be getting him
Holy mama! Jakob Chychrun has exploded this year! He's finally playing like an elite defenseman this season so far. And he also has one of the best contracts in the NHL. The price will be huge, but he's worth it for teams who have their window right now. *Wink, wink, Toronto*

Some teams have interest in Vladislav Gavrikov from the Columbus Blue Jackets. We believe Gavrikov is better defenseman than this card shows. In the last year he was an above-average defensive defenseman. His value shouldn't be so high.

The wild card is not the problem. It's the NHL insisting on having brackets to pre-determine the way teams advance.I'd suggest going back to 1-8 in both conferences and reseeding each round, but I'm guessing DraftKings and FanDuel would have veto power over that.

lots of people seem upset that the NHL trade deadline is 1,000 times worse than the NBA's. not me - last night, I saw adam sandler live then got a full night of sleep. more work? no thanks!
@seangentille I don't see that strong of a connection. Adding a serviceable body on D will cost a first or close to it, prices are high at the deadline. But Chychrun is obviously levels above that, he's more like headline prospect, first and something else price tag.

When women are encouraged to be competitive progress is definite. Mark the dates &amp; don't miss the action
Hockey¬†allows women to clear their minds of academic and social pressures, to literally skate off tension that's accumulated in their muscles. Mastery. Hockey gives women &amp; girls a satisfying, enjoyable way to develop their talents and skills.
Early NHL Power 2Really liking both plays here.  Verhaeghe has gone 4+ in 7/L8.  Book line 3.5, getting him for 3 on PrizePicks. Had 4 SOG last game vs Sharks.  Hedman has hit 5/L5 vs COL. 3,5,7,3,3 SOG.Let's cash!

@RJHenderson7 @CHEK_News Very very well said.  I work in an industry that uses its employees as pawns.  Bigger cheques for the higher ups, while the little guy loses his job.  Sad times
The NHL needs big ass trades to happen like they do in the NBA, there would be so much more hype around the sport
@BigFlamesGuy1 I knew that line could be a good fit, just needed huby and Naz to get going again and pelts to really start fully realizing his game in the NHL

@CoachRyps Just not true.
nba trades are like "yeah we just traded a 7th grader and 3 starting players for one guy"meanwhile nhl trades are like "hey man we really want your 3rd pair right handed dman but all i have to offer is a 5th round pick and some guy. sound good?"
@alyssaturnz all gas no brakes bay-bee
Why can‚Äôt the NHL have fun trades Give me Stamkos and two first rounders Boston for Pasta or something. NBA‚Äôs trades are wild
@xTechHockey what about Kane getting absolutely toyed with
NHL GMs: those crazy NBA guys always doing wild things, we can‚Äôt give up Jackson McBarry he‚Äôs the locker room DJ and the boys love Jason Aldean and he‚Äôs a real glue guy playing 6:46 per game
@AndyLevang @JDylanBurke Artist rendition.
NBA vs NHL
@TheStanchion He should try it
If you're an NHL fan hoping for a deadline similar to this NBA madness, I've got good news for you: The entire league either has no cap space or is tanking, the biggest names are mostly depth guys, and every GM is petrified of trading futuresWait, that's not good news

Someone make a trade.
@thegoldenmuzzy Still can't understand why they want to trade him, watched him live vs the oilers last year, and he was unreal against McDavid and Leon.
NBA GMs are flipping all-stars for shits and giggles while NHL GMs have finished their warm cup of milk and are drifting off to la la land.
@thejustinfisher He needs to take few games off from the BS honestly the refs are showing their bias against him and some of sh1t he did is to blame
It‚Äôs funny how little movement there is in the NHL compared to the NBA.The biggest contract to get traded this season in the NHL is Bo Horvat and his $5.5M cap hit which Vancouver had to retain on to facilitate
@SatiarShah Stillman is brutal, needs to be gone by Mar 3, not next year
Look, I know the NBA trade deadline feels a little more exciting than hockey's but trust me: You're going to get the same thrill as the KD deal when Vladislav Gavrikov gets traded for a conditional second-rounder in the day's biggest move.
@wyshynski @SarahSpain @gwiss is this guy your hockey namelganger?
NBA trade deadline vs NHL trade deadline
@TheStanchion He should try it
We need these type of chaos trades in the NHL instead we will get a paragraph in 32 thoughts about how it was crucial for x team to trade a 5th round pick for a 4th line checking plug lmao.
@dhockey13 You know theyre 9-1-2 in their last 12 right
The NBA's trade deadline goes crazy
@HockeyDaily365 None of it would have happened if Sid didn't take an Olympic dive on the "cross check." The misconduct was silly and unnecessaryto begin with, but come on dude, you're way stronger than that.

@Voice_OfReality EXACTLY!They're way bigger haters and divisionist than we'd ever even imagined.
Stupid beat if you had Rangers -1.5, should have been awarded a goal for Chytil there. Have been on the wrong end of that a few times this year and it is awful.

This 7-game homestand coming up is a murderer's row of opponents. Wild staring at a fifth loss in seven games. Ominous feeling the way this team is playing since the calendar turned Jan. 1....And I'm including the points in 7 of 8 where they were mostly lucky

Astounding that the continue to play guys like Reaves, Steel, and Merrill while Shaw and Goligoski sit in the press box and Rossi (the prospect in the best farm system in the NHL) is stuck in the AHL.

@NHL_Watcher I remember well the feeling of winning your Stanley Cup on Feb 11.
Hot, hot, Chytil! Filip Chytil continues his great play by potting his seventh goal in a five-game goal-scoring streak!: : @Sportsnet
@NHL @kdach77 no offense but dvo just scored his 200th point find a better caption for this goal
It's amazing how many fun trades there are in the NBA and the NHL is full of "depth forward gets moved for a conditional 7th rounder in 2074" deals.
@RobWong34 @RinkWideTOR It's been all quiet lately, and contrary to Dubas' public comments but how about Dylan Larkin

Filip Chytil extends his goal streak to five games (7G), tying his career-long streak (Nov. 12-21, 2018). His 11 goals since January 3rd are tied for the third most in the NHL.

With Demko coming back, I wonder if there is a market for either Martin or Delia. We've seen teams (Pittsburgh and Carolina) going 3 goalies deep in the playoffs. I think a mid pick is reasonable. Their numbers aren't great - but they have played a ton of NHL games this year
@seyerpa Bruce was lovable . Maybe too lovable. These guys didn‚Äôt respect him enough. Like the substitute teacher. Once again we gotta look towards next year already.  Hope Tocchet gets them going. Win or loss, work hard every game. Like torts  did with Philly this year.

@BeerlyHockey Does anyone care about Canadian teams.
I don't consider Wayne Gretzky's career points record unbreakable. It's only unbreakable under the current rules. There's always the chance the NHL dramatically alters the game (3-on-3 all the time, soccer nets) in the next 20 years and Sergei Ovechkin scores 2,858 points.

Buffalo continues to lock up their young core early. Taking a gamble on young talent, but the upside is high as the cap continues to rise. Do you like this contract?

GOATS of each sport (imo):NFL: BradyNHL: Gretzky (Ovechkin has a statement though)NBA: LeBronMLB: Ruth/AaronSoccer: Messi (Maybe Pele)Tennis: Nadal, Djokovic, and Federer take 33.3% of the GOAT status each.
@ChargersPlsWin Ovi doesn't have a say at all. Take away all Gretzky's goals and he still has almost 800 more points than Ovi. Ovi is a career +83. Gretsky is a +520. It ain't even close.
With Lebron breaking the NBA scoring record, I would like to say that I was at the (NHL) games where Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin each recorded their 1,000th point. Purely coincidental both times.

Including tonight's game, the Oilers have out-scored the opposition at a rate of 47 - 38 at 5v5 *without* McDavid and Draisaitl on-ice (55.3 GF%).With at least one of McDavid or Draisaitl on-ice, the Oilers have actually been *out-scored* 65-66 (49.6 GF%).Did not expect that.
@NHL_Sid Even if the oilers get him they will continue to rely on nurse and that will forever be a disaster and they will never win. And in 2 years when 97 and 29 leave u will be stuck for 6 more years of 25. And still no cup. That will be the biggest fail ever

There's so much to like about Bo Horvat's goal. His initial puck pressure to take possession back after losing the faceoff, his quick recognition to put himself in scoring position for Barzal, and finally his ability to finish. Let that sink in, fans.

That‚Äôs an unforced error from the Oilers bench. That goal only happens because the first unit was out for the whole two minutes. Should have changed halfway, with a two goal lead.
@AdamsOnHockey Vegas is gonna an absolute hot mess in a couple years.
The designated survivor is Labor Secretary Marty Walsh who is leaving the Biden Administration to join the NHL Player's Association.

Watching this Edmonton game it‚Äôs highly likely Jesse Puljujarvi will either be traded or waived before Sunday
@worldhockeyrpt him and mcdavid coast like that all the time
Is Blackhawks winger Patrick Kane is prepared to entertain a trade?His agent, Pat Brisson, tells @PierreVLeBrun there should be clarity ‚Äúrelatively soon‚Äù.Not to mention the Oilers and Kings may have overlapping blue-line targets?More rumblings:
@TheAthleticNHL Game misconduct was obvious he refused to leave the ice (can't blame him a bit) .. the official MUST answer what the 10 mins was for. A push? All he did was push the guy who cross checked him. Where is the accountability from the HORRIFIC officiating we're seeing each night now?!
Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin have been held without a shot on goal through two periods. From what I can tell, they last each went without a shot on goal in the same game on May 8, 2021, vs Buffalo. Penguins won 1-0.
@OtherNHLCrosby Not a mistake.  Pittsburgh was always a chronological mistake in the game from a pacing perspective.  KC is a more southerly route which you would definitely take over I-80 as it would be winter damaged, desolate and lack supplies.  No population along I-80‚Ä¶

@NHLRago Perry and Maroon are what I call s**t stirrers who use their tenacity to get this somewhat lazy bunch motivated at certain times. Cole takes too many dumb penalties and it's possible being pared with Cernak is not the best fit for him.

@JFreshHockey This really is a great representation of the top goalies in the league
Why is every single open-ice hit being over-analyzed and beaten to death? Hockey is a contact sport. Open-ice hits are legal, and great for the game. Non-hockey observers need to sit back, sip their margaritas and take a chill-pill.
@Mike_Danton Because a lot of the barking is now coming from inside the game...and why does every good hard clean check necessitate a fight...you would almost think the players hard some sort of sweetheart deal with each other...it's turning into a stick check league...and it sucks

Bolduc shows that remarkable seeing-eye wrister that me and @TLOMitch talked about for his first NHL goal!
@islanders_takes There is really only one player Im entertaining calls for at this point. But nobody is calling for Bailey and his $5m anchor.I dont hate Josh but they could use the cap space in july and Simon would be a nice fit with Bo and Barzal.At leat move him out of the top 9 for a while.
Welcome back fellas!
@NHLBlackhawks ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzflop
Samuel Bolduc. First career NHL goal. Seeing eye shot. up 1-0 with 12:01 to go in the first.
@stefen_rosner The incentives need to be adjusted for a while. Instead of rewarding them for goals and PP success they need to recognize shutout periods. Lane needs to figure out how to do this and get them back to focusing on their D and throttling their offensive aggression.

Per @PR_NHL, Brayden Point required the sixth-fewest number of games to hit the 30-goal mark in franchise history. It took him 50 games. Steven Stamkos has the record from when he scored 30 in 38 games during the 2010-11 season.

@Nachtbrezel @studiosupes John Byrne does not strike me as a particularly pleasant person, His writing on the Spider-Man titles in 2000 was horrid. He also wrote and drew some of the most impactful, and in some cases revolutionary, superhero comics of the past fifty years. These can all be true.
Bolduc may have no points through first 4 games, but he's been strong defensively. He's used his body effectively, and the biggest standout, to me, has been his scanning of his surroundings before he gets the puck and his accuracy of passes from the d-zone.
@stefen_rosner The incentives need to be adjusted for a while. Instead of rewarding them for goals and PP success they need to recognize shutout periods. Lane needs to figure out how to do this and get them back to focusing on their D and throttling their offensive aggression.

He's found a home here. Stick taps to Will Borgen tonight, for impending career game in the NHL.
@Benton_Mike 4-3,  getting a little tight here
I'd be fairly open for business trying to acquire 1st round picks and/or prospects that will be ready to play in the NHL next year. Literally, no one is off limits.As for the rebuild, start by finding the right winger for Eichel, then go big/defensive everywhere else.

Looking at the ratings of the NHL, it‚Äôs getting to be quite ridiculous that they are automatically included in charts like this and MLS/soccer is not. MLS would be No. 3 here btw.

In your opinion, what's the worse option if you're an NHL team making a deadline trade?  Basically, is it better for a team to get less than the value of trading a good player when selling, or buying at the deadline and overpaying for a player?

Look at the guy in the Oilers jersey in the lower left hand corner. He‚Äôs happy because the Rangers beat the Flames, and so his 2nd favorite team is whoever is playing Calgary. Same with NYR-NYI. That‚Äôs why NHL needs more rivalry games. Just 3 this season? Utterly absurd.

Also want to note that 2020‚Äôs Stadium Series between the Kings and Avalanche is the least-watched NHL outdoor game on network TV.
If you haven't live tweeted a hockey game and typed another four letter "uck" word instead of puck, I question how long you've actually been covering the game.

Matthew Tkachuk's offense this season is a little absurd, extending beyond 4 standard deviations in all even strength categories.

DeMar DeRozan is 49th in the NBA in assists per game but 2nd in hockey assists per game (the pass before an assist). Draws so much attention in the midrange that it opens up passing lanes for teammates to keep the ball moving to open guys against a scrambling defense.

The Athletic‚Äôs @scottcwheeler has the Blue Jackets ranked No. 3 in his current rankings of NHL prospect pools. Which prospect is leading the way? You‚Äôll have to Czech it out.
@JacketsInsider @monsinour Probably a conservative estimate that he'll be flirting with the NHL around 2024-25 or 2025-26. Juniors/World Juniors next year at 19 and then into the AHL at 20 when he's eligible. The Jackets are very deep on the wings so they can afford to be patient with him.

@YBrammer Thanks didn‚Äôt even realize live that walker was there and pokes it away
For the first time in the 70-year history of the Beanpot hockey tournament, the final will feature Harvard vs Northeastern. Almost unbelievable that it‚Äôs never happened before, but that‚Äôs just how dominant the 2 schools on Comm Ave have been over the years.
@rodmacneil Interesting. With only these 4 teams playing each year that does seem mathematically improbable.
"You can just tell he's a smart player. He's a really really good hockey player. I think we all saw that tonight"- Mat Barzal on Bo Horvat

How does it feel to B-U?
@GoNUmhockey
HISTORY MADE! and Harvard will meet in the final. For the first time in the 70-year history of the , both BU and BC will be absent from the title game. A changing of the guard in ‚Äôs hockey elite.
@GoNUmatt @GoNUmhockey @GoNUathletics @Northeastern Be specific, the men's .
Chychrun again! What a shot by Jakob Chychrun and we're tied up at 2!
@HockeyDaily365 None of it would have happened if Sid didn't take an Olympic dive on the "cross check." The misconduct was silly and unnecessaryto begin with, but come on dude, you're way stronger than that.
Maybe the wild asking price for Jakob Chychrun wasn‚Äôt too high‚Ä¶.
@worldhockeyrpt WAIT WAIT WAIT‚Ä¶. You meant to tell me that ‚ÄúLast man back Leon‚Äù didn‚Äôt backcheck very well?!??
It took 70 YEARS but we finally have the very FIRST Harvard vs Northeastern title game for the Beanpot!With the same four teams involved year after year, the fact these two teams had never met in the title game was one of college hockey‚Äôs most surprising pieces of trivia
And in case anyone was wondering, the final boy‚Äôs varsity score today was:Maple Grove Crimson: 3Andover Huskies: 2
The Beanpot without a title sponsor: 69 non-NU/Harvard finals The Dunkin Beanpot: 1 NU/Harvard Final

Fought until the end. Thanks for all the support, Terrier Nation.
@TerrierHockey @MaineIceHockey @QU_MIH
For the first time in Beanpot history, BU and BC will play each other in the consolation game. Since the Beanpot started in 1952, either BC or BU has played in the finals until now ü§Ø
@TeamECH @NDHockey @B1GHockey Bischel was so good all weekend. He made almost 90 saves. Ohio State deserved more than 1 point but he stole the show.
For the first time in the 70-year history of The Beanpot, Northeastern and Harvard will meet in the championship next Monday.Northeastern 3, BU 1
@chnews Your books don‚Äôt go back that far‚Ä¶
FINAL: NU 3 BU 1. The best game of the year for NU and they finish it off in style. Hats off to Levi. It's the Huskies and the Crimson in the final, words that have never been uttered before.

i hope ellen hughes is somewhere cheering
@stressedhockey I was at a game where he got a shutout and he pulled the net down His names Yaroslav Askarov if anyones wondering!
Watching BU play Northeastern. Two best players on the ice Lane Hutson for BU who will be a star for Monteal in the NHL and Devon Levi goalie for Northeastern who will be starting and staring for the Sabres at some point in the future. Both putting on a clinic

@EthanGSN Exactly. It‚Äôs a personnel problem. This Roster is still so flawed. Losing Toews and leddy over the last few seasons has left a gaping hole on the roster. I don‚Äôt think Lane is it but this roster still needs a lot of ‚Äúretooling‚Äù
Flames did what they do best. Win while losing. It's keeping them within striking distance in Bettman's screwed up NHL.

Wow! @NHL Officiating Does It Again ! @NHLFlames Player Kicked The Puck In The Net! Of Course The @NYRangers Lose The Review! What Else Is New! 3-3 Now
@JohnLukeNYC Sir, why am I never invited!!???
What is the NHL‚Äôs Definition of a kick!?!?Do they even know

Scotty Bowman. coach to be sure. Best dressed too!
@hockey_samurai S. Richer.
NHL video replay has been god awful this year. Just incomprehensible officiating
@EmmaVigeland
It breaks my heart that the greatest player in NHL history and the current best player in the league got together‚Ä¶‚Ä¶to advertise gambling.
@passittobulis Tocchet is exactly what the team didnt need. All they needed was a new D Core and Horvat out of the room for new leadership.
This is deflected according to the @NHL
@TylerRichard93 bad and stupid take, or spoken like someone that hasn‚Äôt had their clothes lost for a few days at the beginning of their trip
Guess what? THAT'S A GOOD GOAL! Just for everyone from New York who sent in their opinions.
@NHLFlames
Paliza de Florida Definitivamente la especialidad de la casa, qu√© bueno regres√≥ la
@BetIcebreaker
The NHL thinks it‚Äôs only a kick if you hit it like a 1960s NFL kicker. Whatta joke.
@GardenFaithful @Canes Everyone always says that but there are COUNTLESS NY‚Äôers who have moved out of NY and go to games where they live now. Across the country.
Beanpot rivalries are in full force at the semifinals as Harvard and BC fans try to say one nice thing about the other school

@BlueSeatBlogs Considering the state of Rangers Twitter last season, I probably shouldve expected a break kink to be in the realm of possibility.

GameScore Impact Card for Florida Panthers on 2023-02-06:
@hockeystatcards It's still early in the season I know... But maybe the kid just isn't ready for the NHL yet? With the media hounding him, the pressure of being considered the next "great one", fuck I wouldn't be able to handle that shit. Maybe having him in the minors for another year or two

@okstatehockey @jared_clifton @ChadNabors @JasonMcEndoo Pokes4Pucks Lets Ride
Remember when Di Giuseppe killed it at last year's training camp, then was sent to the minors simply because Green didn't trust him to kill penalties... only for the club to track with having the worst PK in NHL history through the first three months of the year? haha
@CodySevertson Columbus is out of reach. Canucks could go 3-22-4 the rest of the way and still finish ahead by current pts pace. The absolute best case here is 3rd worst.

0-0 after 1. 13-5 Arizona on shots. The ice is supposed to be incredible here, but pucks bouncing and shipping and hopping everywhere, especially over sticks on the three Coyotes power plays. Wild very lucky for that and that Marc-Andre Fleury didn't get bloated in Cancun
@RussoHockey @JoeSmithNHL One of the most enjoyable games I've seen in a long time. Love the Duhaime Ek Boldy line.
Phil Di Giuseppe tallies his first goal in 710 days to tie it up at 4 in the third for the Canucks!
@HockeyDaily365 None of it would have happened if Sid didn't take an Olympic dive on the "cross check." The misconduct was silly and unnecessaryto begin with, but come on dude, you're way stronger than that.

If you don't like this hit then you might as well just own it and say you want the NHL to ban hitting. This is as clinical as it gets.
@AdamZHerman Did you intend to make the Ithaca connection there? Bravo
Matthew Tkachuk's 5 points are the second-most every by a player in their first game after being named MVP at the All-Star Game.Mario Lemieux holds the record with 6, per @PR_NHL.
@JamesonCoop good thing lately has def been turning the 3rd period game around. just needs to be a full 60 min effort
Boldy slashing minor. So, two issues before the break haven't been solved. They can't score 5-on-5 and they take penalty after penalty
@RussoHockey @JoeSmithNHL One of the most enjoyable games I've seen in a long time. Love the Duhaime Ek Boldy line.

This Rangers/Flames game is unreal. Great way to welcome NHL back after the All-star break. Some nice goals, and many big hits. Has a playoff vibe to it. Third period should be great.

It's time for Milan Lucic to make his presence known. He is in the lineup for games like this. It's time for him to let the NHL know that you can't push around the Flames. Nikita Zadorov could step up with a big hit right now too.

The NHL wonders why ratings are down ‚Äî there‚Äôs many reasons, but these types of hits disappearing and the subsequent freak out by the opposing team when they do happen is a big reason why. It‚Äôs a contact sport! It‚Äôs fun! Hockey!

@SiriusXMNHL Omg...bolts 2 back of leafs with 2 in hand Good thing they won their cup in November
Later buried by the media, the NHL backed an All-Trans Draft Tournament in Nov 2022, pitting (male) trans women against (female) trans men. A slight check from a biological man sent a biological female into the boards with a concussion. Mixing men and women's sports is dangerous.

According to @thegoldenmuzzy, it looks like Jakub Vrana will not play any more games with the Detroit Red Wings. He'll be traded or Detroit will buyout him in the offseason. We don't know what exactly happened there, but Jakub Vrana is a NHL player, if we talk about his skills.

John Marino is in tonight for the New Jersey Devils. Before that injury, Marino was one of the best defensive defensemen in the NHL this season. If he plays on this level until the end of the season, it'll be huge addition for the Devils.

Friday, NHL on ESPN TV Ratings:1.023M: NHL Skills CompetitionThat‚Äôs just slightly down (essentially flat) from the 1.086M that watched last year‚Äôs Skills Competition. This year‚Äôs edition still ranks as the 2nd most-watched since 2012 (1.10M).
Also want to note that 2020‚Äôs Stadium Series between the Kings and Avalanche is the least-watched NHL outdoor game on network TV.

Here is my 13th offering in @TheAthletic @NHL99 project, a profile of the greatest defenseman in NHL history, Bobby Orr. I met Orr for the first time when I was a camper at Jim Pappin's Holiday Hockey Ranch and he dropped by to visit some of his old pals:
@eduhatschek @TheAthletic @nhl99 What‚Äôs your opinion on McDavid‚Äôs ranking? The NHL99 preamble says the timeframe being considered is ‚Äò67-now, but the McD article says he‚Äôs that high, in part, for what‚Äôs to come‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt seem Matthews (projected by Athletic at 750+ goals) or McKinnon, were afforded the same.
Some new wallpapers to get you ready for Night tomorrow
@PredsNHL What happened to him?
have activated Chris Tanev off IR, per the NHL‚Äôs media website. He‚Äôs set to return to the lineup tonight in New York after missing two games before the break.Active roster at 23 after yesterday‚Äôs recalls of Jakob Pelletier and Dennis Gilbert.
@Fan960Steinberg Markstrom has had criticism, but I wonder how his performance would improve if the team was scoring more and taking the high pressure off him as the sole source of a chance to win. have been so weak on offense; must improve their methods, not personal talent levels.
Duluth East's postponed game with Champlin Park from last Friday will take place tomorrow, Tuesday, Feb. 7. Glad they found a new date for this one!

While how much this 1st Beanpot title in particular contributed towards the Huskies future success is harder to say than it is for 1980 men's, the classic thrill of the Beanpot certainly helped the Huskies on the recruiting trail and with drawing eyes to the new program. (14/14)

@bostonsportsinf That defense was incredible, has to be a top 10 in nfl,but they were so good,they won so many games that year,held opponets,crushed offenses,remember they changed the rules because of how tough,badass they were
"Black fans need to respect the racism from our players. And women need to respect some of our players saying they belong in the kitchen."That's essentially what NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has said, in defending the public homophobia of @NHL players.
@CydZeigler Devastated. I didn‚Äôt know Howard when I came out publicly in 2014. He sent his congratulations and said if he was the one who had helped me in that process, he wouldn‚Äôt do anything different. High praise from a true LGBTQ champion. You will be missed Howard. Thank you

NHL GMs who aren't trading for Jakub Chycrun right now are very smart. Play the waiting game with Arizona, I think what ends up happening is by the deadline, AZ significantly lowers their asking price (either drops the prospect, or one of the 1sts) for the sake of the Bedard race

A misunderstanding has lead to some CHL Final home section tickets being sold to visiting fans from Finland which is not possible due to event safety restrictions. The CHL is currently looking into a solution to help resolve the matter. Please allow us time to work on this.

@ProShopHockey Another reason for Hasek to not like Soviets. lol
Haven't considered any VGK players as targets (assumed they'd be buyers), but William Carrier might be the most impactful bottom-six forward at 5v5 in the NHL right nowHe's playing 4th line minutes, is signed through next season at $1.4M &amp; is an absolute menace on the forecheck
@nylanderthews @LeafsUpdates21 Translation - they all have no clue
Rested. Refreshed. Ready for hockey.During the bye week, some players hit the beaches of Florida, others the mountains, and a big group spent time together in the Bahamas.

No Bruins but this has to be one of the best hockey fight photos ever. John Mariucci punches "Black Jack" Stewart. The various facial expressions are priceless. The two battled for some time down the exit to the dressing rooms. The score? 0-0.
@BruinsBook The 113-point, 1975-76 ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ played fewer stinkers after (43-10-15) than before (5-5-2) the Nov. 7 blockbuster, but by this point Bobby Orr's 10GP with Brad Park were a fading dream and Gerry Cheevers had just returned but yet to start. You won the lottery Jeff!

In my experience, when you have a group of players that are fully invested in each other's success, it becomes much easier to execute your game plan and achieve your goals. So, make sure to prioritize team bonding as often as possible, and watch your team grow as a unit.
@PositiveHockey1 Totally understandable. And it‚Äôs important for parents and kids, when they recognize how they‚Äôve been showing up and influencing, to give themselves grace and commit to showing up their best moving forward.

The top five teams in the NHL by points percentage are in the Eastern Conference (BOS, CAR, NJ, TB, TOR).When comparing the Leafs to the other top five teams, their lack of forward depth is evident.

The Last of Us show replaced Pittsburgh with Kansas City. First actual mistake they've made.
@OtherNHLCrosby Not a mistake.  Pittsburgh was always a chronological mistake in the game from a pacing perspective.  KC is a more southerly route which you would definitely take over I-80 as it would be winter damaged, desolate and lack supplies.  No population along I-80‚Ä¶
With the 154th overall selection in the NHL Draft, the New York Rangers are proud to select: Paul Pogba.

Of the players I thought the Sharks may offload, Megna was not on my Bingo card.
@IanBlogsHockey @CheechYouFTF Retaining as much as they did, would‚Äôve hoped they got quite a bit more out of that deal. Was a lot of real cash and cap space being used for Burns not to play for them and Carolina gave up nothing of real significance.

@SportsiCohn I was a massive basketball fan growing up, but I completely lost interest in the sport in the early 2000's when the game was changing into to a flopping contest, and the end of fourth quarters became unwatchable due to the excessive timeouts and intentional fouling.

Devils ML/over 4.5 MGM -140 Can make an SGP on DK too. Devils ready to play meaningful hockey where as the Canucks are a dumpster fire. Devs won 5-2 earlier this year I see similar result. VAN should be selling heavy at deadline. High total and i like over too.

Perhaps I‚Äôm biased, but the AHL Skills Competition tonight beat the absolute crap out of whatever the NHL was attempting in their event. Seven events, a crisp and entertaining two hours, and a handful of unforgettable moments.
@dps2002 I agree with you totally, however I still think they could of signed some veterans that can score ,like all the other teams did. We have a roster of basically an ECHL team ,with a few exceptions

I just burst out laughing when I saw this tweetSeattle had the best roster in the entire CHL even BEFORE adding Guenther. Going back years, I genuinely can't think of the last time a team in the WHL, OHL or QMJHL was this ridiculously stacked
@Derek_N_NHL Thanks sharing. What town is it?
Bordeleau breakaway challenge
@IanBlogsHockey @CheechYouFTF Retaining as much as they did, would‚Äôve hoped they got quite a bit more out of that deal. Was a lot of real cash and cap space being used for Burns not to play for them and Carolina gave up nothing of real significance.

Guys aren‚Äôt getting to spots fast enough, could be retrieving puck in corner to getting puck and not getting it to a forward fast enough.  Being .5 seconds slower than the other team matters

If you were drafting a team to win a junior title, you would likely select both Benson and Cristall top 5. They are fantastic juniors. You would also have taken Rossi top 3. NHL teams aren't drafting based just on performance, however, they are trying to project NHL upside.

Break the NHL up into two sixteen team leagues with four-team divisions. It works in NFL, the most successful major-league sport. Have divisional rivals play each other eight times a year. Put some testosterone back in the game.
According to GQ, the top 10 earning male models earned a combined total of $8 million in 2018, compared to the $83 million the top supermodels of the world acquired over the same year. Why? The female fashion and make up industry is huge compared to the men. They earned it.

Playing 1,000 games in his NHL career means a lot to Jamie Benn, but for the Dallas Stars captain, one aspect of the milestone stands out most.
@NHLdotcom McDavid was a minus 3 or 4, including the shortie by Dvorak in the 3rd. I think McDavid was on the bench for the rest of the game after that.
That tops Andrei Svechnikov (13.699 seconds) at the NHL Skills Competition.There are plenty of speedsters at this level.
@pwilliamsAHL @Yves1958 They're in a playoff mode already. Love it!
Sam Lafferty has had the greatest week of an NHL player all season. Bro went from a 4th liner on the worst team in Hockey to all of a sudden being the missing piece to ending a 15 year second round drought and 55 year cup drought
@Noah_Banx @Totally_Offside Timmins was in even worse shape when traded. The thing is, no one is offering their top prospects. NYI unloaded Raty because he's a 0.5ppg AHL player. So ultimately, you often see guys like Robertson and Timmins in these deals because they have value b/c of their ceiling.
Two of the first AHL All-Stars in the Fastest Skater -- Michael Carcone and Ethen Fank -- both beat Andrei Svechnikov's 13.699 seconds in the NHL's Skills Competition.First try.

See lots of talk about Horvat being 28 when the contract kicks in. And, yes, we'll see how it ages. But if you need an example of a center improving into his late 20s/early 30s, another one of them was literally just at the All-Star game representing the Islanders

Debrincat will get his 7 x 9 or 8 x 8.5 for sure. The issue for the Sens is that they forced a short term move when it's still a rebuild. Everyone in hockey knew Debrincat would make 2 x 9 and could walk to total free agency, with clubs having very little leverage.

@Barford_Tigers @MRHARESULTS We really struggled recently for my adult sized son. Ended up buying a second hand kit off ebay and taking an aftermoon ofc to drive to Bath for it, lol.But yeah the second hand sites was where we ended up. There wasn't a huge amount around.
Jonathan Toews will not practice today: non-COVID related illness.

Lou sticks to his policy of not releasing contract terms. "It's too long and it's too much money."Price of doing business in the NHL.
@AGrossNewsday It‚Äôs really going South quicks. Pens killing it in West Coast. Caps just beat Bruins. Devs/Rangers surging. And us, we‚Äôre losing to Vanc., Montreal. If they lose in Ottawa, you can‚Äôt let Lambert on the plane home. Sorry.

At some point the Islanders are probably going to be hurt by their lack of high end prospects and picks. At the same time, Horvat-Barzal-Dobson-Sorokin is a pretty nice core group to build around for the next half-decade or so.
@KKurzNHL Have they lubed the light post in Philly for today?
Athletic Band plays hockey.
@TBDBITL @OhioStateWHKY Go Bucks  !!!
Bo Horvat is a very good player. Many teams would have wanted him in offseason. But considering what they gave up in trade and the desperation to sign him, it may be fair to say he was more valuable to today than he would be to any team in 5 months. Lou paid up.

Bo Horvat, signed to an 8x$8M extension by NYI, is a top six centre with a great finishing touch between the hashmarks, especially on the powerplay. Not a big playdriver but pretty well-rounded offensively. Defensive results lag behind the reputation.

@NYIHockeyNow You‚Äôre right. About 2 months ago would have been the time.
Bison take it 5-7. Huge disappointment for Lightning as they lose the points at home. Credit to Bison who worked hard and had a game plan to disrupt, but also took their chances very very nicely. Safe travels home.

@CMhockey66
Throwback to 1997 when Gordie Howe laced up at the age of 69 for the Detroit Vipers in the IHL.  It marked the only hockey pro to compete in six consecutive decades. 1940s - 1950s - 1960s - 1970s - 1980s - 1990s
@HockeyTomorrow No, as it's different with a one game playoff. Football doesn't have much in advantages per fields like NHL rinks and plus NHL is a 4 out of 7 concept.

My father-in-law Frank Bonello turns 90 today. He was a hockey icon back in the days. He won a gold medal at the world championships in 1958 with the Whitby Dunlops. Two Memorial Cups with the Toronto Marlies as a coach and manager. He signed  the Howe brothers in 1972.

Larry Hillman. After the Leafs won the Cup in '67, Hillman held out for a raise, didn't get it &amp; was fined for holding out. When Hillman left the Leafs the next yr, he vowed the Leafs wouldn't win Cup again until he was repaid what he was fined. In 2017 he was repaid w/ interest.

@Balas_Wolverine No designed play to their best player.  Why?  Throwing up threes hoping they will go in is not a plan.  This is on Howard and more of what we have seen since he has been head coach.  He was given a program on the rise with good players and he has failed to build it further.
This is a good choice. Sanderson, at 20, is showing a lot of potential and could be an elite defenseman in two, three years. We'll see.

This week the society is watching the 1992 Disney film The Mighty Ducks.  Let's turn back the clock to the height of Michael Eisner's powers. Hit the ice with us and see what a plucky band of youths can do against a youth-league hockey juggernaut.
@MedfieldFilm @ProgressCityUSA This Sunday, let's remember that even the team who is not the underdog are just a human as you and me.
This is the just a symptom of a larger issue in hockey &amp; why the @NHL needs to do more to make hockey for everyone. These attitudes have no place in this world. What not taking a more harder stand on crap like this only emboldens people like this looking for validation.
@CntrLeafsNation @MapleLeafs @BlueJacketsNHL They‚Äôre not playing Tampa every night.And they lost the series last year.Show me Tony Room‚Äôs stats, I could show you a winner. Show me his playoff record and I will show you who he is.
Interesting thread about changes being debated for NHL regular season schedule and playoff format. IMO, more divisional games seems like a no-brainer.
@vzmercogliano He's gaining confidence and getting better

Brilliant! For context, at the 2003 NHL Entry Draft, the Panthers tried to draft Ovechkin multiple times. Although he born two days after the cutoff for that year‚Äôs draft class, the Panthers tried to argue that Ovechkin was eligible if leap years were taken into account
@mikecommito Mike Marson and Bill Riley are rarely heard from today and not even referred to in "Black Ice". Mike was often on Toronto sports radio mid 90's.
